        "**Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans1- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which bundle together data (attributes) and the functions that operate on that data (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q2. What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans2- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It is a user-defined data type that defines the structure and behavior that its objects will possess.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3. What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans3- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental building block that represents a real-world entity or concept within a software system. It is an instance of a class, which acts as a blueprint defining the object's structure and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans4- Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object, while encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods together in a single unit and restricting direct access to the data to protect it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans5- Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are a core feature of Python that enable objects to interact with built-in functions, operators, and language constructs in a customized way. The term \"dunder\" is a shorthand for \"double underscore,\" referring to the double underscores that prefix and suffix their names (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans6- Inheritance, in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), is a fundamental concept allowing a class (the derived class or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (the base class or superclass). This establishes an \"is-a\" relationship, meaning the subclass is a specialized version of the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans7- Polymorphism is a core OOP concept where an object can take on many forms, allowing a single action to have different behaviors depending on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans8- Encapsulation in Python, while a core principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), is achieved through conventions rather than strict enforcement mechanisms found in languages like Java or C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q9. What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans9- In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object. Its primary purpose is to set the initial state of an object by assigning values to its attributes when an instance of a class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans10- In Python, both class methods and static methods are defined within a class but differ in their binding and access to class or instance state.\n",
        "Class Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "Decorator: Defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "First Parameter: Takes cls as its first parameter, which refers to the class itself. This allows the method to access and modify class attributes and call other class methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "Decorator: Defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "First Parameter: Does not take self (instance) or cls (class) as an implicit first parameter. It behaves like a regular function, but is encapsulated within the class's namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q11.What is method overloading in Python? **\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans11- Method overloading in Python refers to the concept of having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a single class. Unlike languages like Java or C++, Python does not support traditional method overloading where you define separate methods with different signatures. Instead, Python achieves a similar effect through more flexible argument handling mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans12- Method overriding is an object-oriented programming concept where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans13- The @property decorator in Python allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, providing a way to manage and control access to class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans14- Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" is a crucial concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) due to its ability to enhance code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability. Its importance stems from several key aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability and Modularity\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility and Extensibility\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans15- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It is designed to define a common interface or structure that its subclasses must adhere to. This is achieved by including one or more \"abstract methods\" within the abstract class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans16- The main advantages of OOP are modularity, reusability, and security, which lead to more organized, flexible, and maintainable code. OOP simplifies complex systems by breaking them into self-contained objects, and features like inheritance and polymorphism allow for code reuse and adaptability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans17- The fundamental difference between instance variables and class variables lies in their scope, ownership, and how they are accessed and stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ownership: Belong to a specific instance (object) of a class. Each object created from a class will have its own independent copy of instance variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Declaration: Declared within a class but outside of any method, constructor, or block, and without the static keyword (in languages like Java).\n",
        "\n",
        "Lifetime: Created when an object is instantiated and destroyed when the object is garbage-collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Access: Accessed through an object reference (e.g., objectName.instanceVariable).\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Used to store data that is unique to each individual object.\n",
        "Class Variables (Static Variables):\n",
        "\n",
        "Ownership: Belong to the class itself, not to any specific instance. All objects of that class share a single copy of the class variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Declaration: Declared within a class but outside of any method, constructor, or block, and with the static keyword (in languages like Java).\n",
        "\n",
        "Lifetime: Created when the class is loaded into memory and exists for the entire duration the program runs or until the class is unloaded.\n",
        "\n",
        "Access: Can be accessed using the class name (e.g., ClassName.classVariable) or through an object reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Used to store data that is common to all objects of a class, or to represent properties of the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans18- Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, enabling it to acquire attributes and methods from all of its base classes. This differs from single inheritance, where a class inherits from only one parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans19- In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special methods (often called \"dunder methods\" due to their double underscores) that define how an object is represented as a string. They serve different purposes and are intended for different audiences:\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__ (for users):\n",
        "Purpose: To provide an informal, human-readable, and concise string representation of an object. It's meant for end-users and should be easily understandable.\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__ (for developers):\n",
        "Purpose: To provide a formal, unambiguous, and detailed string representation of an object, primarily for developers and debugging. The goal is that, ideally, eval(repr(obj)) should reconstruct an equivalent object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans20- The super() function in Python holds significant importance within the context of object-oriented programming, particularly concerning inheritance. Its primary significance lies in facilitating the interaction between a child class and its parent (or super) class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans21- The __del__ method in Python, also known as the destructor, holds significance primarily in resource management and cleanup operations when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans22- The primary difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python lies in their access to class and instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod:\n",
        "Takes cls as the first argument: A class method receives the class itself as its first argument, conventionally named cls. This allows the method to access and modify class-level attributes and call other class methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod:\n",
        "No implicit first argument: A static method does not receive self (the instance) or cls (the class) as its first argument. It behaves like a regular function defined within the class's namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans23- Polymorphism in Python, when combined with inheritance, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, enabling a single interface to be used for various implementations. This is primarily achieved through method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans24- Method chaining in Python OOP is a programming technique that allows for calling multiple methods sequentially on the same object in a single expression. This creates a concise and readable flow of operations, often referred to as a \"fluent API.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans25- The __call__ method in Python serves to make instances of a class callable, allowing them to be invoked like functions. When an object with a defined __call__ method is called using parentheses (e.g., my_object()), the __call__ method of that object is executed.\n",
